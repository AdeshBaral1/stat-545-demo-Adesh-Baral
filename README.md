I am graduate student working at Jan lab, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. My study is to undersatnd how virus hijack the host immunune system using the its proteases which not only process the virus polyprotein but also cleave host imoprtant proteins. The protein we are interested in is 14-3-3 epsilon which activates the RIG-I pathway ( Important parthway for type I immunity, IFN B production). During the virus (+ss RNA) infection, 14-3-3 epsilon gets cleaved by the virus protease, forming a long N terminal fragemnt and short C terminal fragemnt. We named the N terminal fragmet as 3CN, pervious PhD student from our lab found out this 3CN dampens the RIG-I signaling pathway and suppress the IFN-B production. My goal is to find out how this cleaved product (3CN) is involved in RIG- I pathway which interm dampens the production of IFN-B
