I am graduate student working at Jan lab, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. My study is to understand how virus hijack the host immune system using the its proteases which not only process the virus poly protein but also cleave host important proteins. The protein we are interested in is 14-3-3 epsilon which activates the RIG-I pathway ( Important partway for type I immunity, IFN B production). During the virus (+ss RNA) infection, 14-3-3 epsilon gets cleaved by the virus protease, forming a long N terminal fragment and short C terminal fragment. We named the N terminal fragment as 3CN, previous PhD student from our lab found out this 3CN dampens the RIG-I signaling pathway and suppress the IFN-B production. My goal is to find out how this cleaved product (3CN) is involved in RIG- I pathway which intern dampens the production of IFN-B.
